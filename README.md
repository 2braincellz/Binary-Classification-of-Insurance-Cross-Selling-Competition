Kaggle's Season 4 Episode 7 Playground Series Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling Competition

Concluded with a competition score of 0.85604 determined by the ROC AUC score of the model resulting in a placement of 1419/2234 (top 64%) of competitors

Main Strategy: Hyperparameter tuning with Randomized CV on Decision Trees Classifiers and implemented Random Forest Classifier as the ensemble method to bag the individual decision trees together into a much more effective model

Would definitely love to further explore feature engineering as well in future competitions and other ensemble methods such as gradient boosting, but overall very proud of myself and absolutely looking forward to more Kaggle competitions soon.
